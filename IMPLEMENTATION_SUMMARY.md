## 🔧 Backend Implementation

### **Files Created:**

1. **`ml/advanced_recommender.py`** - 15 recommendation algorithms (600+ lines)
2. **`ml/train_advanced_recommender.py`** - Training script with testing
3. **Updated `backend/app/routers/recommendations.py`** - Enhanced API with new parameters

### **API Endpoints:**

```python
# Basic hybrid recommendations
GET /recommend/{user_id}?n_recommendations=10

# Specific strategy
GET /recommend/{user_id}?strategy=popularity

# Context-aware
GET /recommend/{user_id}?context=evening

# Personality-based
GET /recommend/{user_id}?personality=adventurous

# Combine multiple
GET /recommend/{user_id}?context=night&personality=romantic&n_recommendations=20

# Retrain models
POST /recommend/retrain
```

### **Query Parameters:**

- `n_recommendations` (1-50): Number of books to return
- `strategy`: `popularity`, `trending`, `content`, `collaborative`, `demographic`, `context`, `quiz`, `association`
- `context`: `morning`, `afternoon`, `evening`, `night`, `weekend`, `workday`
- `personality`: `adventurous`, `intellectual`, `creative`, `romantic`, `analytical`

---

## 📊 How It Works

### **Hybrid System Weights:**
```python
{
    'popularity': 15%,      # Trending/popular books
    'content': 20%,         # Similar content
    'collaborative': 25%,   # Community preferences  
    'demographic': 10%,     # User group patterns
    'context': 10%,         # Time/mood based
    'quiz': 5%,             # Personality match
    'association': 15%      # Books read together
}
```

### **Diversity Optimizer:**
- Prevents showing too many books from same genre
- Adds novelty bonus (slightly prefers less popular gems)
- Includes serendipity factor (pleasant surprises)

## 🎯 How to Use

### **For Users:**

1. **Sign in** to your account
2. **Rate some books** (at least 3-5 for best results)
3. Go to **Home page** - you'll see the **Recommendation Selector**
4. **Choose your strategy:**
   - Click any strategy card (Hybrid, Popular, Content-Based, etc.)
   - Or use **Advanced Options** to set context and personality
5. **Browse recommendations** with match percentages
6. **Click any book** to read details or start reading!

### **For Developers:**

#### **1. Export Data & Train Models:**

```bash
# Option 1: Via API (export data)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/recommend/retrain

# Option 2: Direct training (if data exists)
cd ml
python train_advanced_recommender.py
```

#### **2. Models Auto-Load on Server Start**

The backend automatically loads trained models from `ml/models/` on startup.

#### **3. Test Recommendations:**

```bash
# Test in browser
http://localhost:3000/  # Sign in and check recommendations

# Test API directly
http://localhost:8000/recommend/1?strategy=popularity
http://localhost:8000/recommend/1?context=evening&personality=adventurous
```
