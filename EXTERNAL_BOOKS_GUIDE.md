## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Problem: Page shows "No trending books available"
**Solution**: 
1. Check backend is running: http://localhost:8000/health
2. Try searching instead of waiting for trending
3. Backend might need to warm up (first request is slower)

### Problem: "Read" button does nothing
**Solution**:
1. Book might not have preview available
2. Try the "More Info" button instead
3. Some books are info-only (not readable online)

### Problem: Search returns no results
**Solution**:
1. Try simpler search terms ("Python" vs "Advanced Python Programming")
2. Check spelling
3. Try switching source (google ↔ openlibrary)

### Problem: Images not loading
**Solution**:
1. Some books don't have covers
2. External API might be slow
3. Refresh the page
